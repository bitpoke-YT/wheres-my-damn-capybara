INSTRUCTIONS

Inspired by Diner Dash

Playing the game requires only the left mouse button.

Your objective in this game is to deliver the orders to each Environment (Forest, Ocean, City) as quickly as you can in order to try and achieve the highest Score.



On the top right corner you have your inventory where the grabbed item is stored.  On the bottom left corner is where your score is shown and on the bottom right corner, you have 3 bells you lose one when you failed to deliver the order, you lose all and its game over. 

Here is some help if you don't know what shed the item is in.

Orange shed: Plant, Coffee and Fish.

Blue shed: Capybara, Book, and Kelp.

Green shed,: Cloud/Rain, Bus, and Coral .
